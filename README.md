# EmbeddedsystemsFINAL
This project is the final exam of Embedded systems, where i and two of my colleagues (Mihal and Oliver) built a smart home device. 

This project is a smart home device that reads temperatures inside and outside with a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor. 
The project components is:



2 x DHT22 sensors
1 x Wemos D1 R1
1 x Raspberry Pi 3 or 4
1 X Raspberry Pi LCD Touchscreen 7 inches (acts as a hub) '

2 or 3 x breadboards
Male to Male, Female to Female and Female to Male cables 
Power sources for both the outside wemos and inside raspberry pi

The outside: 
DHT22 connected to a Wemos D1 R1 and  a breadboard will send via WiFi information from the sensor to the raspberry pi that will translate the outside temperatures to the touchscreen. 

The inside: 
A sensor is connected to a breadboard that is equally connected to the raspberry pi and that will translate the inside temp. to the touchscreen. As well as, an api call for information respectably from any city in the world with weathermap. 


IDE used: Arduino IDE; visual studio;

All the code is based in past classes and practices done as well as some other wonderful writers of code throughout the interwebs.
