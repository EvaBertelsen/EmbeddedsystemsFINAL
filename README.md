# EmbeddedsystemsFINAL
This project is the final exam of Embedded systems, where i and two of my colleagues (Mihal and Oliver) built a smart home device. 

This project is a smart home device that reads temperatures inside and outside with a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor. 
The project components is:
2 x DHT22 sensors
1 x Wemos D1 R1
1 x Raspberry Pi 3 or 4
1 X Raspberry Pi LCD Touchscreen 7 inches
2 or 3 x breadboards
Male to Male, Female to Female and Female to Male cables 

The outside: 
DHT22 connected to a Wemos D1 R1 and  a breadboard will send via WiFi information from the sensor to the raspberry pi that will translate the outside temperatures to the touchscreen.

The inside: 
A sensor is connected to a breadboard that is equally connected to the raspberry pi and that will translate the inside temp. to the touchscreen.

IDE used: Arduino IDE

All the code is based in past classes and practices done as well as some other wonderful writers of code throughout the interwebs.
